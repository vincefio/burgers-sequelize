# burgers-sequelize

Burgers-Sequelize is a restaurant application that allows users to add a burger that they would like to eat to a list.  And then devour the burger when they would like to!

Behind the scenes I am using sequelize ORM to find, create, and update as the user desires, then rendering them to the page using express-handlebars

Npm packages used in this project are body-parser, express, express-handlebars, method-override, mysql, and sequelize
