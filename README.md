# burgers-sequelize

Burgers-Sequelize is a restaurant application that allows users to add a burger that they would like to eat to a list.  And then devour the burger when they would like to!

Behind the scenes I am using sequelize ORM to find, create, and update as the user desires, then rendering them to the page using express-handlebars

Upon loading the page the user can see which burgers are available, and which have already been eaten

User can then input any burger they'd like

The user then has the opportunity to devour the burgers they've created

After a burger has been devoured it moves to the devoured list on the right
